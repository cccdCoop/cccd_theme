                                        <p>Our worker-owned cooperative offers a win-win for clients and caregivers. Our caregivers co-own the business and we chose this work because we enjoy caregiving.  
                                        The worker-cooperative model gives us control over the decisions that affect our workplace and daily lives. This benefits our clients who gain quality services from a 
                                        committed team.</p>

                                            <p><i>Co-op Home Care</i> was developed by a local non-profit, the California Center for Cooperative Development (CCCD).
                                        The premise of the project is that people who need home care support deserve quality services from a consistent caregiver, and 
                                        caregivers deserve work stability, livable wages, and positive working conditions. The worker cooperative model is mutually beneficial
                                        for clients and caregivers: caregivers gain workplace advantages that encourage them to stay, and clients receive quality, reliable care
                                        from a consistent caregiver.  </p>
