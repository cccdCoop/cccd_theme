                    <p> 
Thank you for considering Co-op Homecare. We specialize in providing quality, compassionate caregiving services.</p>
 
<p><b>Our mission is to provide compassionate, high quality in-home support services to our clients.</b></p>
 
<p>Our worker-owned cooperative offers a win-win for clients and caregivers. Caregivers co-own this business; we chose this work because we enjoy caregiving.  The worker cooperative model provides us control over our workplace policies and better compensation.  This benefits clients who gain quality services from a committed team.</p>  
 
<p><i>Co-op Homecare</i> was initiated as a project of the local non-profit, the California Center for Cooperative Development (CCCD).
The premise of the project is that people who need home care support deserve quality services from a consistent caregiver, and 
caregivers deserve work stability, livable wages, and positive working conditions. The worker cooperative model is mutually beneficial
for clients and caregivers: caregivers gain workplace advantages that encourage them to stay, and clients receive quality, reliable care
from a consistent caregiver.  CCCD expects to be providing assistance to the cooperative through 2021 to provide a solid foundation for 
business success and growth. The goal is for the cooperative to grow and offer worker-cooperative opportunities to more caregivers within 
Yolo County and to expand to provide quality and compassionate home care in Dixon, and, eventually, areas in Sacramento.
