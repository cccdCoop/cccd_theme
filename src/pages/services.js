                                Most caregivers are specially trained in caring for clients across the spectrum of progressive dementia. 
                                Training includes compassionately and skillfully recognizing cognitive and psychological/behavior changes.

                                We provide personal care services for adults who are recovering from a serious injury or illness, have  
                                chronic conditions or progressive diseases, physical disabilities, or cognitive disabilities.

                                We accept private pay clients and cater to client needs. We will work with Long Term Care Insurance Plans 
                                for client claim reimbursement.   At this time we are unable to accept public pay clients, but hope to 
                                expand our services to include a wide range of public pay options in the future.

                                changes or cancellations are frequent, We may be forced to decline future services or to 
                                impose the late cancellation fee if continued services are desired.
